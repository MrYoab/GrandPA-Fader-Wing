Servus griasts aich!

This is the code for my 3d printed Controller for the MA Dot2 onpc software.
I've used an arduino pro micro paired with a matrix of 32 keys and 8 Faders connected to 2 4 bit multiplexers.
The arduino sends MIDI commands to dot2 onpc via USB to control executors.
The 3d print files and instructions can be found on my Makerworld (MrYoab). As soon as the project is finished.
